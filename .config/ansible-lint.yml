# Some rules can transform files to fix (or make it easier to fix) identified
# errors. `ansible-lint --fix` will reformat YAML files and run these transforms.
# By default it will run all transforms (effectively `write_list: ["all"]`).
# You can disable running transforms by setting `write_list: ["none"]`.
# Or only enable a subset of rule transforms by listing rules/tags here.
